Product Brief — Restaurant Table Management (MVP)

Target User

- Restaurant front-of-house staff: hosts, servers, and managers.

Key Problem

- Lack of a simple, real-time view of table availability and reservations causes longer wait times, double bookings, and inefficient seating.

Solution Overview

- A lightweight web app that shows a visual floor plan with table statuses, a simple reservation manager, and a quick walk-in intake—all updating instantly on the client.

Core Features (MVP)

- Table Overview: Color-coded statuses (available, occupied, reserved, cleaning) and one-click actions.
- Reservation System: Create, edit, cancel, delete; assign to a table.
- Real-time Updates: Frontend state reflects changes immediately; backend can be added later.
- Walk-ins: Quick add for immediate seating.

Success Metrics

- Reduced wait time from arrival to seating (target: -20%).
- Decrease in double-booking incidents to near-zero.
- Staff satisfaction (qualitative) and fewer manual coordination steps.

Future Enhancements

- RTK Query-backed API, SMS confirmations, overbooking guardrails, shift-based analytics, and multi-floor support.
