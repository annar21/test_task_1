Development Process (MVP) and AI Usage

Scope

- Build a frontend-only MVP for table management with a strong visual layout and simple local state (Redux Toolkit). Another developer will wire APIs later.

Workflow

1. Baseline scan of project (Next.js 15, Tailwind v4).
2. Install Redux Toolkit and scaffold store with `tables` and `reservations` slices.
3. Build composable UI: `FloorPlan`, `ReservationsPanel`, `WalkInPanel`, and `LayoutShell` with Tailwind.
4. Wire interactions: create/edit/cancel reservations, assign to tables, and update table statuses.
5. Add docs and run through a visual QA for responsive layout.

AI Tools Usage

- Code generation: Accelerated scaffolding for Redux slices and React components.
- UI iteration: Rapid styling using Tailwind utility suggestions.
- Refactor assistance: Converting layout to App Router root layout and segment layout.

What benefited most

- State modeling of reservations and tables; ensuring intuitive actions and minimal clicks.
- Visual polish and responsiveness without a UI design tool.

Time saved (estimate)

- ~4â€“6 hours saved on initial scaffolding and UI polish versus hand-rolling from scratch.

Next steps for backend integration

- Replace local reducers for CRUD with RTK Query endpoints and optimistic updates.
- Persist state to a database, add authentication, and handle conflicts (double booking) on the server.
